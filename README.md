# Capture - Simple screenshot tool using PhantomJS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mmoulton/capture.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mmoulton/capture)

Capture, as it's name implies, will capture a screenshot of one or more URL's using [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org). The format of the screenshot can be anything supported by Phantom, such as PNG, GIF, JPG, or PDF.

Capture is a Node.js based library that can be used as a module within another application, or as a stand alone tool via it's command line interface (CLI).

## Install

To install capture you must first have Node.js, NPM and PhantomJS installed, all of which is outside the scope of these instructions. Please see the [Node.js Website](http://nodejs.org) for details on how to install Node and NPM. Personaly I am found of Tim Caswell's excelent [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) tool for insalling and managing Node. [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) is also an excelent tool for installing PhantomJS, Node or NPM on a Mac.

Once NPM is installed, simply install Capture by executing the following from the command line:

	npm install capture -g


## Command Line Usage

Once installed, you can explore what capture can do by simply typing `capture` into the command line. You will get the built in help that looks something like this:

	Capture screenshots of URLs.
	Usage: node ./index.js [url1 url2 ...]
	
	Options:
	  --verbose, -v              Verbose logging                                     [boolean]
	  --out, -o                  Output directory for captured screenshots           [string]
	  --format, -f               Output image format (png, jpg, gif, pdf)            [string]  [default: "png"]
	  --phantomjs, -P            Path to phantomjs bin                               [string]
	  --username, -u             HTTP Basic Auth Username                            [string]
	  --password, -p             HTTP Basic Auth Password                            [string]
	  --viewport-width, --vw     Minimum viewport width                              [string]  [default: 1024]
	  --viewport-height, --vh    Minimum viewport height                             [string]  [default: 768]
	  --paper-format, --pf       Size of the individual PDF pages (A4, letter)       [string]  [default: "A4"]
	  --paper-orientation, --po  Orientation of the PDF pages (portrait, landscape)  [string]  [default: "portrait"]
	  --paper-margin, --pm       Margin of the PDF pages (2cm, 5mm, etc.)            [string]  [default: "2.5mm"]
	  --help, -h                 Show this help message and exit                     [boolean]

Executing `capture http://your-domain.com/ http://your-domain.com/about/` will create a directory in the current working directory with the following structure:

	your-domain-com/
		index.png
		about/
			index.png

### Reading JSON from *stdin*

Capture also supports reading in JSON from *stdin*. It will do it's best to find URL's within the data structure. For example, all of the following data structures are valid input:

**Array of strings:**

	capture << EOF
	[ "http://your-domain.com" ]
	EOF

**Array of Objects with property of *url*:**

	capture << EOF
	[ { "url": "http://your-domain.com" } ]
	EOF

**Object with property of *url*:**

	capture << EOF
	{ "url": "http://your-domain.com" }
	EOF

## Example Use Cases

Capture was written to aid in regression testing of websites where large cross-cutting changes to things such as CSS were made and we wished to understand the visual differences that might exist between an existing version of a site and the newly modified version. To accomplish this, Capture, coupled with [Crawl](http://github.com/mmoulton/crawl) allows us to take screenshots of both the old and new versions of the site, then perform image differencing on the results. One handy tool for performing the image differencing is a Mac app called [Kaleidoscope](http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com).
